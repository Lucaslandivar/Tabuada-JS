<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I work in the Human Resources in a school, and a lot of kids have problems with solving or learning the multiplication table or the square root, so i decide to make a project to help them. I split the project in four parts: <br>
<b>The Multiplication form:</b> Wich is the form were the user add the multiplicator number and he decide how many times is gonna multiplicate by adding the second number.<br>
<b>The Square Root form:</b> Wich is the form were the user add the multiplicator number to know his square root. <br>
<b>The Square Root result:</b> The result is going to appear below the square root form, and it contains the information that the user asked. <br>
<b>The Multiplication result:</b> The result is going to appear below the square root result, an it contains the information that the user asked.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can help the kids in my school with their math problems and also to learn more about the DOM in JavaScript and how to make more complicate equations.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>To use the project is simple, just add a number that you want to know the multiplication table of, and add a number to make an end to the multiplication table result.</p>
